Put another way, the DOGE Boys are delusional if they think they can reimplement decades and decades of code in six months, even with generative AI (which will honestly probably make things much worse). Worse yet, there seems to be no good reason for it other than “the code is old and written in a language we don’t know,” which is an absolutely <em>terrible</em> reason to rewrite a system like this. One of my big gripes about the software engineering discipline (at least based on what I’ve been exposed to, and even my own biases as I’ve grown in my career) is how the longevity of a system doesn’t seem to be terribly valued and appreciated. “Good” code is not necessarily clever code or code based on the new hotness of the month — it’s the code that is flexible enough to withstand change while still performing well and reliably, and I just don’t see where the Social Security system falls short in this regard. But then again, I’m not a late-teens/early twenties tech bro that knows everything, either.</p>\n",

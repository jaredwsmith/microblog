			 <p>Should hopefully see Beta 4 of all of the new Apple OS releases this week. Beta 3 hasn‚Äôt really been that bad. Some app crashes and restarts here and there on the phone, but overall, nothing too out of the ordinary in a beta cycle. iPad has been in good shape, with the occasional app crash and a few bugs in Stage Manager, but again, it‚Äôs been pretty solid all things considered. (Ventura has been really good so far, too, though it could still use some performance tuning and tweaks to Stage Manager.)</p>
<p>Thinking beta 4 is probably going to be one of the last times we see big changes in spots before turning focus to polish in August. If Apple is going to make feature cuts for 16.0, we‚Äôll probably see that in the next 2-3 weeks.</p>

			 <p>There‚Äôs a bad bug in the latest Keynote update for iPadOS (and probably iOS, too). If, on first launch, you open a presentation with font warnings, after dismissing the font warning box you‚Äôll be presented with a totally unresponsive Keynote. You have to open a presentation with no font warnings (or start a new one) in order to get Keynote to get going, which I accomplished through the Haptic Touch context menu. Once that‚Äôs done, you are prompted with the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new in Keynote‚Äù modal‚Ä¶which likely was the culprit for the whole thing. Ugh.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jaredwsmith.com/2021/09/26/iphone-pro-max.html">iPhone 13 Pro Max snap judgements</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jaredwsmith.com/2021/09/26/iphone-pro-max.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-09-26 09:48:41 -0500">Sep 26, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I received my iPhone 13 Pro Max on Friday. Here‚Äôs my snap judgements so far. (Please note that my complaints are solidly rooted in first-world problem territory.)</p>
<ul>
<li>ProRAW makes RAW capture so, so, so much more doable on the iPhone. On the iPhone 11 Pro Max, RAW photos would often overexpose horribly when pulled into apps like Darkroom. This is no longer the case and I am very happy.</li>
<li>Getting the 256 GB model may have been a mistake given how much I like ProRAW.</li>
<li>Low light performance is as advertised. It‚Äôs bonkers how good it is; after reducing the light pollution in post, the <a href="https://glass.photo/jaredwsmith/1n7QIqvr2AEXYpfYxWBt6o">starfield in this photo is amazing</a>. This was a 10-second Night Mode capture right out of the stock app which I tweaked in Darkroom.</li>
<li>Condensing the TrueDepth system and getting a little more screen space back is a win, but the notch has never really bothered me overall. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how app developers take advantage of the extra space. (I see Apple has declined to do so in this initial release aside from making the time and indicators larger.)</li>
<li>So far, so very good with battery life. Here‚Äôs hoping there isn‚Äôt such a sudden decline in health as I saw on my 11 Pro Max.</li>
<li>The iPhone 4 vibes are very real with this phone, right down to the placement of the antenna gaps in the outer stainless steel band. Kind of uncanny. (But it certainly performs well no matter how you hold it.)</li>
<li>ProMotion has spoiled me on the iPad Pro, and it is so great to finally have it on the iPhone.</li>
<li>One thing I will miss from my iPhone 11 is the lack of a bottom lip on the Apple Leather case. This not only made swiping up more smooth, it also gave me a good indicator as to which way was ‚Äúup‚Äù when pulling the phone from the pocket. This is not the case with the 13 (and probably wasn‚Äôt with the 12, either, but I skipped that), and already I‚Äôve run into a few cases where I pull the phone out, try to unlock it, only to find it‚Äôs upside down.</li>
<li>iOS 15 is still buggy. I sure hope that Apple fixes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/26/apple-to-fix-iphone-13-unlock-with-apple-watch/">the bug that breaks Apple Watch unlock</a> while wearing a mask very soon. It‚Äôs quite inconvenient.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/c7tyg8/bug_notification_stacks_sometimes_overlap_each/">overlapping notifications bug</a> was annoying in the betas. In the final release, and especially on new hardware, it‚Äôs unacceptable. I hope this is getting fixed in a point release, because it is so aggravating (to the point where I might have to miss notifications because I can‚Äôt get them to display).</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the hardware is great. The software will get better over time (theoretically, anyway). Certainly a must-have upgrade on the X or older, IMO, especially since the Max and standard-size Pro have feature parity this go-around (unlike the 12 Pro and Pro Max).</p>

			 <p>What‚Äôs on my mind to start the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚öæÔ∏è Good for Reiss Knehr, getting his first major league win in a bullpen game for the Padres. I like his mettle.</li>
<li>‚öæÔ∏è Thank goodness Tatis is back. San Diego desperately needs his bat ‚Äî and his swagger. So far, so good in right field. It‚Äôs a nice luxury to have Jake Cronenworth, a natural shortstop, be able to slide into that position and not skip a beat. Also, how good does that Adam Frazier trade look now?</li>
<li>‚öæÔ∏è The Padres just cannot be dropping series to the likes of the Diamondbacks if they expect to make it very far into October (or even the playoffs at all). The Dodgers and Giants have much better records against the teams that they should beat.</li>
<li>‚åöÔ∏è Where is watchOS 8 public beta 5? Is Apple just going to skip it and seed us with beta 6 this week? (Presuming, of course, we go to weekly releases starting this week.)</li>
<li>üñ• I really, really hope the external monitor struggles in Monterey beta 5 are resolved soon. The new release botched the black point on my new 4K LG monitor, and now <em>both</em> the USB-C and HDMI monitors kick on briefly at random intervals. (Previously, only the USB-C/DisplayPort monitor did this.)</li>
<li>ü§î Why exactly <em>do</em> I torture myself every summer with betas?</li>
</ul>
<p>Be good to each other.</p>

			 <p>So far, so good with the fifth betas of iOS and iPadOS 15. Refinements are definitely starting, but there are still plenty of rough edges, which is to be expected at this stage. I‚Äôve come to really enjoy the notification summaries ‚Äî I added a midday summary to my slate, for a total of three ‚Äî and find Focus modes extremely helpful. Syncing Focus state across devices solved a problem I didn‚Äôt realize I had until I added the iPad to the mix back in June, when my phone would be on Do Not Disturb but I would forget to set the iPad.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm running the dev seed of Monterey on my 2015 MBP, and had a bit of a scare last night when I went back to it and it was powered off. I fired it back up, but it promptly went into a reboot loop every time I tried to log in. Shutting the machine down and powering back up took care of it, and the installation finished successfully. I‚Äôve not spent much time with it since then, though. Here‚Äôs hoping the public beta goes on a little smoother today on the M1.</p>
<p>Hoping for a watchOS 8 public beta today as well. Battery struggles are very, very real on beta 4 on my Series 4, so here‚Äôs hoping those rough edges start to smooth out on beta 5.</p>

			 <p>I think the time is coming to ditch my 4K TN-paneled monitor that I&rsquo;ve got attached to my Mac mini. I don&rsquo;t game, I live in text, and I am still unaware of anything better than an IPS panel for textual applications. (I honestly wonder how much eyestrain I&rsquo;ve incurred because of the TN panel.)</p>
<p>Trying to decide if going ultrawide is worth it at this point, or if I should just stick to a standard wide IPS display with a second monitor rotated into portrait as I have today. If I go ultrawide, I can take the secondary monitor (which has an IPS panel) and move it over to my AWIPS workstation, replacing another older TN panel. On the other hand, I recoil at the price of high-DPI ultrawides, so I might just do the swap.</p>

<p>New shirt! A little more niche this go-around. Here&rsquo;s a wearable love letter to meteorologists' favorite hunk of Java code anywhere, <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/products/awips-stack-trace#/10406600/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-black-tri-blend-s">AWIPS</a>.</p>

			 <p>A year ago, I decided to retire my long-standing WordPress setup for my personal blog and set up a <a href="https://jaredwsmith.github.io">GitHub pages website</a> via Jekyll so that I could accomplish the highly esoteric and somewhat impractical goal of blogging entirely through <code>vim</code>. (Quarantine goals ‚Äî when we thought the lockdown period would only be about 2-3 weeks ‚Äî were naively lofty.)</p>
<p>And as it turned out ‚Äî as so many of my attempts to write on a consistent basis about something other than weather often do ‚Äî it died on the vine after only five posts. I had the best of intentions, but some <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredwsmith">habits</a> are hard to break.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had good luck with syndication for <a href="https://micro.blog/chswx">@chswx here on micro.blog</a>. There are certainly kinks to work out, especially as it relates to how WordPress handles images and how that translates over to the service, but it has been pretty solid. But, still, some <a href="https://twitter.com/chswx">habits</a> are hard to break. I&rsquo;m trying, though.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;ve wanted a place for a while now to briefly comment on links or other things that I&rsquo;ve found useful. However, when considering the cost-benefit analysis of spinning up and maintaining another WordPress install to handle that, it was like‚Ä¶nah. (And yes, I know about WordPress.com&rsquo;s hosted offering. It&rsquo;s good! But too much for what I&rsquo;m trying to do here.)</p>
<p>So, here we are at <code>micro.blog</code>. I&rsquo;ve transitioned the domain name over, so jaredwsmith.com now resolves here (in case you haven&rsquo;t checked your address bar ;)). I&rsquo;m happy about this move for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The micro.blog client is good for posting quickly from the hip. I like that.</li>
<li>$5/mo to handle mostly infrequent long-form writing peppered with a lot of short-form stuff is well worth it for not having to keep up with security patches on a self-hosted service. (And, it keeps the lights on here ‚Äî micro.blog is a really important project for the indie Web!)</li>
<li>I get to use my all-time favorite blogging tool again in MarsEdit.</li>
<li>I get to write long-form within iA Writer and save the drafts up.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I get to use really good software to do my writing, it is easily exportable and stays with me forever, and I don&rsquo;t have to deal with patches (yet can customize the living you-know-what out of this!) And, if I wanted to, I could still use <code>vim</code>.</p>
<p>With the environmental stuff out of the way, it&rsquo;s once again back on the breaking-old-habits train. See you there?</p>

			 <p>Just installed Monterey on my MBP and am giving the new Safari two-factor authentication magic a whirl. So far, mixed results for autofill from websites, but it&rsquo;s early. Where it does work, it&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>This post by Dan Moren from Six Colors helps you <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/07/migrating-2fa-codes-from-authy-to-apples-system/">migrate Authy two-factor codes to Safari</a>. it is a little tedious, and depending on how your Authy is set up, it may require a little trial and error, but it <em>works</em> &ndash; a massive timesaver especially since I don&rsquo;t plan on additional migrations to Monterey or iOS 15 for a while yet.</p>

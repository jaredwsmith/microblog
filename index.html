			 <p>Kind of unreal that iPadOS 26, with its focus on upgraded multitasking, still doesn’t have a way to create a shortcut that runs when connecting a Smart Keyboard. I just want to switch multitasking modes when a keyboard is connected vs. when it isn’t. Too much to ask?</p>

<p>Personal nerd and poor financial decision milestones were achieved today: I got a VESA-mountable Apple Studio Display to pair with my M2 Pro Mac mini. This is my first-ever Apple desktop display of my own. It&rsquo;s been just a few hours, and I haven&rsquo;t had much time with it, but so far, so good. I&rsquo;m coming from a 27&quot; 4K LG monitor that I was upscaling to 5K to get more breathing room in the UI, and there&rsquo;s definitely an improvement not only in text sharpness, but even in system graphics performance now that the GPU doesn&rsquo;t have to upconvert every UI frame.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with the Studio Display supporting True Tone, I thought for sure that it would go into a color temperature mismatch with my secondary 24&quot; LG 4K display. That&rsquo;s not the case, though: the True Tone support on the Studio Display also extends out to the monitor that doesn&rsquo;t support it. That&rsquo;s pretty nifty, IMO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not really used the webcam yet (though my tests show that the firmware updates seem to have helped at least in my environment). The speakers are excellent, though, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying the microphone on calls.</p>
<p>Having the three USB 3.1 ports available is quite nice, with plenty of bandwidth to go around. I have both of my FaceCams (one a FaceCam Pro, another a FaceCam Mk. 2) plugged into the monitor now, and I&rsquo;m getting hitch-free uncompressed video from both. In the previous configuration, the hub on the LG monitor only supported USB2 speeds because I was using DisplayPort-over-USB, so I got MJPEG compression from the Mk. 2. The Pro was plugged directly into the Mac. The other bright side here is that I was able to free up a Thunderbolt 4 port directly on the Mac.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one caveat, I think it&rsquo;s the panel&rsquo;s response time &ndash; feels like my LG was a little quicker in this department. But it&rsquo;s not a dealbreaker as I really don&rsquo;t do any hardcore gaming on this machine. I leave that to the iMac G3 in the kitchen. :)</p>

			 <p>iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia is very, very, very good. There&rsquo;s not too much in the initial release of Sequoia and iOS 18 that I really care about, but this is one of those very nice quality of life improvements you didn&rsquo;t know you needed until you got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really impressed with how many of the details are just right. For instance, notifications that come through native to the Mac do not duplicate from the iPhone. That is huge in and of itself; could&rsquo;ve been a real deal-breaker for folks! Being able to take action on notifications right from the Mac is a spot that Apple could have very easily half-assed, but they saw it through properly not only with opening the correct app on the mirrored iPhone when clicking on a notification, but also allowing for quick actions on the notification without invoking the Mirroring interface.</p>
<p>In future releases, I&rsquo;d love the ability to invoke the Control Center from the Mac. I&rsquo;d also like to see the notification about iPhone Mirroring being invoked collapse automatically when the phone is in StandBy mode. (It feels like it did this initially &ndash; not sure if I tweaked a setting that ultimately caused this behavior to change.) But beyond that&hellip;there&rsquo;s not much I&rsquo;d choose to improve at this point from my relatively limited (~2 weeks) experience with it.</p>

			 <p>Nobody asked, but I do have a small contribution to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8GB RAM on MacBook Pro in the year of our lord 2023<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discourse. (Coherence not 100% guaranteed.)</p>
<p>My first Apple silicon machine was a Mac mini M1 with 8GB of unified memory. I was quite pleased with its performance (and probably still would be!) especially compared to the 2015 MBP it replaced. However, I definitely ran into bottlenecks with my &ldquo;pro&rdquo; workflows with that little memory available. And when I hit those bottlenecks, it <em>hurt</em>: the system would become unresponsive, with beachballing and even the cursor becoming rather jumpy. It got to the point where I&rsquo;d have to shut down Docker in order to run OBS, for instance&hellip;and I just grew weary of that limitation pretty quickly. (I&rsquo;d at least feel like I could hit them, though, without feeling like the computer was about to launch into outer space, unlike the Intel machine!)</p>
<p>I traded it in for a Mac mini M2 Pro with 32 GB RAM when that model was introduced earlier this year, and I&rsquo;ve not hit a hiccup since. I&rsquo;ve been comfortable editing relatively complex GIS files, Docker containers, OBS&hellip;you name it, it runs it, and it runs it well. The Pro chip probably helps, but I know everything can fit because it&rsquo;s got plenty of memory to work with.</p>
<p>I think there are a surprising amount of things that folks who get a base M3 with 8GB of RAM can do. I don&rsquo;t totally poo-poo the notion that Apple Silicon can more efficiently manage memory, either &ndash; that M1 could certainly do quite a bit more multitasking more responsively than the Intel equivalent with the same RAM. And, of course, there&rsquo;s the disclaimer that my workflow is generally out of the ordinary. But I still think that &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; means more than a base level of memory. Apple Silicon is pretty cool, but it can&rsquo;t defy the foundational principles of computer science, either.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bug in rpm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Red Hat Enterprise Linux as well as some versions of CentOS Stream that can stop packages from installing. (Convenient, right?) You&rsquo;ll see messages such as <code>signature hdr data BAD</code> when trying to upgrade packages via <code>dnf</code>.</p>
<p>This is how I ended up solving it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d try to upgrade <code>rpm</code> in place via <code>dnf</code> using <code>dnf upgrade rpm</code>. This would fail, but it would cache the packages.</li>
<li>Note the path to the cached packages. On my system, it was <code>/var/cache/dnf/baseos-9a27fc7471a8d219/packages/</code>, but yours may vary.</li>
<li>Use <code>rpm</code> to force install the <code>rpm</code> and <code>rpm-libs</code> packages:
<ul>
<li><code>rpm -i --force /var/cache/dnf/baseos-9a27fc7471a8d219/packages/rpm-4.14.3-26.el8.x86_64.rpm</code></li>

<li>Then, try your <code>dnf install</code> or <code>dnf upgrade</code> procedure again, and it should be fine.</li>

			 <p>Should hopefully see Beta 4 of all of the new Apple OS releases this week. Beta 3 hasn’t really been that bad. Some app crashes and restarts here and there on the phone, but overall, nothing too out of the ordinary in a beta cycle. iPad has been in good shape, with the occasional app crash and a few bugs in Stage Manager, but again, it’s been pretty solid all things considered. (Ventura has been really good so far, too, though it could still use some performance tuning and tweaks to Stage Manager.)</p>
<p>Thinking beta 4 is probably going to be one of the last times we see big changes in spots before turning focus to polish in August. If Apple is going to make feature cuts for 16.0, we’ll probably see that in the next 2-3 weeks.</p>

			 <p>There’s a bad bug in the latest Keynote update for iPadOS (and probably iOS, too). If, on first launch, you open a presentation with font warnings, after dismissing the font warning box you’ll be presented with a totally unresponsive Keynote. You have to open a presentation with no font warnings (or start a new one) in order to get Keynote to get going, which I accomplished through the Haptic Touch context menu. Once that’s done, you are prompted with the “what’s new in Keynote” modal…which likely was the culprit for the whole thing. Ugh.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jaredwsmith.com/2021/09/26/iphone-pro-max.html">iPhone 13 Pro Max snap judgements</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jaredwsmith.com/2021/09/26/iphone-pro-max.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-09-26 10:48:41 -0400">Sep 26, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I received my iPhone 13 Pro Max on Friday. Here’s my snap judgements so far. (Please note that my complaints are solidly rooted in first-world problem territory.)</p>
<ul>
<li>ProRAW makes RAW capture so, so, so much more doable on the iPhone. On the iPhone 11 Pro Max, RAW photos would often overexpose horribly when pulled into apps like Darkroom. This is no longer the case and I am very happy.</li>
<li>Getting the 256 GB model may have been a mistake given how much I like ProRAW.</li>
<li>Low light performance is as advertised. It’s bonkers how good it is; after reducing the light pollution in post, the <a href="https://glass.photo/jaredwsmith/1n7QIqvr2AEXYpfYxWBt6o">starfield in this photo is amazing</a>. This was a 10-second Night Mode capture right out of the stock app which I tweaked in Darkroom.</li>
<li>Condensing the TrueDepth system and getting a little more screen space back is a win, but the notch has never really bothered me overall. It’ll be interesting to see how app developers take advantage of the extra space. (I see Apple has declined to do so in this initial release aside from making the time and indicators larger.)</li>
<li>So far, so very good with battery life. Here’s hoping there isn’t such a sudden decline in health as I saw on my 11 Pro Max.</li>
<li>The iPhone 4 vibes are very real with this phone, right down to the placement of the antenna gaps in the outer stainless steel band. Kind of uncanny. (But it certainly performs well no matter how you hold it.)</li>
<li>ProMotion has spoiled me on the iPad Pro, and it is so great to finally have it on the iPhone.</li>
<li>One thing I will miss from my iPhone 11 is the lack of a bottom lip on the Apple Leather case. This not only made swiping up more smooth, it also gave me a good indicator as to which way was “up” when pulling the phone from the pocket. This is not the case with the 13 (and probably wasn’t with the 12, either, but I skipped that), and already I’ve run into a few cases where I pull the phone out, try to unlock it, only to find it’s upside down.</li>
<li>iOS 15 is still buggy. I sure hope that Apple fixes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/26/apple-to-fix-iphone-13-unlock-with-apple-watch/">the bug that breaks Apple Watch unlock</a> while wearing a mask very soon. It’s quite inconvenient.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/c7tyg8/bug_notification_stacks_sometimes_overlap_each/">overlapping notifications bug</a> was annoying in the betas. In the final release, and especially on new hardware, it’s unacceptable. I hope this is getting fixed in a point release, because it is so aggravating (to the point where I might have to miss notifications because I can’t get them to display).</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the hardware is great. The software will get better over time (theoretically, anyway). Certainly a must-have upgrade on the X or older, IMO, especially since the Max and standard-size Pro have feature parity this go-around (unlike the 12 Pro and Pro Max).</p>

			 <p>What’s on my mind to start the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>⚾️ Good for Reiss Knehr, getting his first major league win in a bullpen game for the Padres. I like his mettle.</li>
<li>⚾️ Thank goodness Tatis is back. San Diego desperately needs his bat — and his swagger. So far, so good in right field. It’s a nice luxury to have Jake Cronenworth, a natural shortstop, be able to slide into that position and not skip a beat. Also, how good does that Adam Frazier trade look now?</li>
<li>⚾️ The Padres just cannot be dropping series to the likes of the Diamondbacks if they expect to make it very far into October (or even the playoffs at all). The Dodgers and Giants have much better records against the teams that they should beat.</li>
<li>⌚️ Where is watchOS 8 public beta 5? Is Apple just going to skip it and seed us with beta 6 this week? (Presuming, of course, we go to weekly releases starting this week.)</li>
<li>🖥 I really, really hope the external monitor struggles in Monterey beta 5 are resolved soon. The new release botched the black point on my new 4K LG monitor, and now <em>both</em> the USB-C and HDMI monitors kick on briefly at random intervals. (Previously, only the USB-C/DisplayPort monitor did this.)</li>
<li>🤔 Why exactly <em>do</em> I torture myself every summer with betas?</li>
</ul>
<p>Be good to each other.</p>

			 <p>So far, so good with the fifth betas of iOS and iPadOS 15. Refinements are definitely starting, but there are still plenty of rough edges, which is to be expected at this stage. I’ve come to really enjoy the notification summaries — I added a midday summary to my slate, for a total of three — and find Focus modes extremely helpful. Syncing Focus state across devices solved a problem I didn’t realize I had until I added the iPad to the mix back in June, when my phone would be on Do Not Disturb but I would forget to set the iPad.</p>
<p>I’m running the dev seed of Monterey on my 2015 MBP, and had a bit of a scare last night when I went back to it and it was powered off. I fired it back up, but it promptly went into a reboot loop every time I tried to log in. Shutting the machine down and powering back up took care of it, and the installation finished successfully. I’ve not spent much time with it since then, though. Here’s hoping the public beta goes on a little smoother today on the M1.</p>
<p>Hoping for a watchOS 8 public beta today as well. Battery struggles are very, very real on beta 4 on my Series 4, so here’s hoping those rough edges start to smooth out on beta 5.</p>

			 <p>I think the time is coming to ditch my 4K TN-paneled monitor that I&rsquo;ve got attached to my Mac mini. I don&rsquo;t game, I live in text, and I am still unaware of anything better than an IPS panel for textual applications. (I honestly wonder how much eyestrain I&rsquo;ve incurred because of the TN panel.)</p>
<p>Trying to decide if going ultrawide is worth it at this point, or if I should just stick to a standard wide IPS display with a second monitor rotated into portrait as I have today. If I go ultrawide, I can take the secondary monitor (which has an IPS panel) and move it over to my AWIPS workstation, replacing another older TN panel. On the other hand, I recoil at the price of high-DPI ultrawides, so I might just do the swap.</p>

			 <p>MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/ios-15-maps-weather-warnings-routes/">reports that iOS 15 will route people around Flash Flood Warnings</a>. At first glance, this appears to be an extremely smart application of the Dark Sky acquisition. It will be interesting to see if this only applies to Flash Flood Warnings or other warning types. It would also be interesting to see if it applies to flood advisories as well. We often see impassable roads here with a Flood Advisory in effect because Flash Flood Warnings in my county warning area are reserved for the most serious flooding events.</p>

			 <p>A year ago, I decided to retire my long-standing WordPress setup for my personal blog and set up a <a href="https://jaredwsmith.github.io">GitHub pages website</a> via Jekyll so that I could accomplish the highly esoteric and somewhat impractical goal of blogging entirely through <code>vim</code>. (Quarantine goals — when we thought the lockdown period would only be about 2-3 weeks — were naively lofty.)</p>
<p>And as it turned out — as so many of my attempts to write on a consistent basis about something other than weather often do — it died on the vine after only five posts. I had the best of intentions, but some <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredwsmith">habits</a> are hard to break.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had good luck with syndication for <a href="https://micro.blog/chswx">@chswx here on micro.blog</a>. There are certainly kinks to work out, especially as it relates to how WordPress handles images and how that translates over to the service, but it has been pretty solid. But, still, some <a href="https://twitter.com/chswx">habits</a> are hard to break. I&rsquo;m trying, though.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;ve wanted a place for a while now to briefly comment on links or other things that I&rsquo;ve found useful. However, when considering the cost-benefit analysis of spinning up and maintaining another WordPress install to handle that, it was like…nah. (And yes, I know about WordPress.com&rsquo;s hosted offering. It&rsquo;s good! But too much for what I&rsquo;m trying to do here.)</p>
<p>So, here we are at <code>micro.blog</code>. I&rsquo;ve transitioned the domain name over, so jaredwsmith.com now resolves here (in case you haven&rsquo;t checked your address bar ;)). I&rsquo;m happy about this move for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The micro.blog client is good for posting quickly from the hip. I like that.</li>
<li>$5/mo to handle mostly infrequent long-form writing peppered with a lot of short-form stuff is well worth it for not having to keep up with security patches on a self-hosted service. (And, it keeps the lights on here — micro.blog is a really important project for the indie Web!)</li>
<li>I get to use my all-time favorite blogging tool again in MarsEdit.</li>
<li>I get to write long-form within iA Writer and save the drafts up.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I get to use really good software to do my writing, it is easily exportable and stays with me forever, and I don&rsquo;t have to deal with patches (yet can customize the living you-know-what out of this!) And, if I wanted to, I could still use <code>vim</code>.</p>
<p>With the environmental stuff out of the way, it&rsquo;s once again back on the breaking-old-habits train. See you there?</p>

			 <p>Just installed Monterey on my MBP and am giving the new Safari two-factor authentication magic a whirl. So far, mixed results for autofill from websites, but it&rsquo;s early. Where it does work, it&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>This post by Dan Moren from Six Colors helps you <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/07/migrating-2fa-codes-from-authy-to-apples-system/">migrate Authy two-factor codes to Safari</a>. it is a little tedious, and depending on how your Authy is set up, it may require a little trial and error, but it <em>works</em> &ndash; a massive timesaver especially since I don&rsquo;t plan on additional migrations to Monterey or iOS 15 for a while yet.</p>
